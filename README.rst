Astrosat-Test is a simple Django project/app to prove to Astrosat that I can code in Django


Quick start
-----------

1. Add "polls" to your INSTALLED_APPS setting like this::

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...
        'polls',
    ]

2. Include the polls URLconf in your project urls.py like this::

    path('polls/', include('polls.urls')),

3. Run `python manage.py migrate` to create the polls models.

4. Start the development server and visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
   to create a poll (you'll need the Admin app enabled).

5. Visit http://localhost:8000/ and enjoy
